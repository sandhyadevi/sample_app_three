# Ruby on Rails tutorial via [Michael Hartl](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/beginning?version=3.2#top/ "Michael Hartl")

##Reflection on Tutorial
* This was difficult.  The tutorial was beatifully laid out and worded, I just found it difficult because it was my first time diving into rails/ruby
* I used external sources for help- the repo Michael Hartl put together, Stackoverflow and another github user.
* My understanding of ruby/rails is still a bit hazy but I have a much better understanding of how it generally works.  I'm excited to dive deeper
